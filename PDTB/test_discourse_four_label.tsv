To a degree, Quantum represents the new times that have arrived for producers of the so-called commodity plastics that pervade modern life	Having just passed through one of the most profitable periods in their history, these producers now see their prices eroding	4

Quantum's annual profit fluctuates by about 85 cents a share, provided no other variables are changing	when the price of polyethylene moves a mere penny a pound	2

Thus, Europe has begun the recent crusade to produce more worthy shows of its own, programs with broader appeal	We've basically got to start from scratch, to train writers and producers to make shows that other people will want to see	1
here many believe that its absence is to blame for the European TV industry's sluggish development	while some in the U.S. contend that advertising is the bane of television	1
Until recently, national governments in Europe controlled most of the air time and allowed little or no advertising	Since production costs were guaranteed, it didn't matter that a program couldn't be sold abroad or put into syndication	2
it didn't matter that a program couldn't be sold abroad or put into syndication	since production costs were guaranteed	2
Since production costs were guaranteed, it didn't matter that a program couldn't be sold abroad or put into syndication	but not much money was spent on the shows, either, a situation that encouraged cheap-to-make talk and game shows, while discouraging expensive-to-produce dramas	1

The result is a new and huge appetite for programming	but perhaps to the consternation of those calling for quotas, most of this void is likely to be filled with the cheapest and most plentiful programming now available -- reruns -- usually of shows made in the U.S	1
Sky Channel, a British-based venture of Australian-American press tycoon Rupert Murdoch, offers what must be a baffling cultural mix to most of its audience	The financially struggling station offers programs obviously made available cheaply from its boss's other ventures	2

After two years of talks, plans for the venture are sufficiently advanced for the companies to seek French and British government clearance	The companies hope for a final agreement by year-end	2
The venture would strengthen the rapidly growing ties between the two companies, and help make them a leading force in European defense contracting	In recent months, a string of cross-border mergers and joint ventures have reshaped the once-balkanized world of European arms manufacture	4
Already, British Aerospace and French government-controlled Thomson-CSF collaborate on a British missile contract and on an air-traffic control radar system	Just last week they announced they may make a joint bid to buy Ferranti International Signal PLC, a smaller British defense contractor rocked by alleged accounting fraud at a U.S. unit	4
Most threatened by closer British Aerospace-Thomson ties would be their respective national rivals, including Matra S.A. in France and Britain's General Electric Co. PLC	but neither Matra nor GEC -- unrelated to Stamford, Conn.-based General Electric Co. -- are sitting quietly by as their competitors join forces	1

Canada's current oil exports to the U.S. total about 600,000 barrels a day, or about 9.1% of net U.S. crude imports	That ranks Canada as the fourth-largest source of imported crude, behind Saudi Arabia, Nigeria and Mexico	2
It's very much a growing concern	but when something is inevitable, you learn to live with it	1
But you learn to live with it	when something is inevitable	2
Canada's declining crude output, combined with the fast-shrinking output of U.S. crude, will help intensify U.S. reliance on oil from overseas, particularly the Middle East	however that the delay of Interprovincial's proposed expansion won't by itself increase U.S. dependence on offshore crude	1
